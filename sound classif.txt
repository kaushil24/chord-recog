**From jon nordby - audio classification [europython conf]**
mel filter spectogram (mimics human hearing)
log scale normalization (to reduce the large spectrum) 
	You can do mean normalization either on mean of each frame or on mean of the whole dataset
librosa (sound processing lib)
SB-CNN is a model for audio classif.
Thesis of: Environment sound classification on microcontroller using CNN: github.com/jonnor/ESC-CNN-microcontroller 
Data augmentation (on spectogram): 
	Time shifting
	time stretch
	pitchshift up (or down)
	
Look Listen Learn (L^3) is a pretrained model to convert 1sec audio into 512 dimentional vector. It has python package called openl3
